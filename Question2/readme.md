# Question 2 
Given 2 sorted arrays A and B with n and m elements respectively. A has enough space at the end of the array to fit in all elements of B. Write an algorithm to merge the elements of A and B ensuring the resultant A is sorted as well. 
* The code cannot use an extra array. 
* Input: A = 1 3 5 6 8 - -  - B = 0 2 10  
* Output: A = 0 1 2 3 5 6 8 10 
 
# Simplified problem statement 
Merge Elements of two arrays A and B

# Time Complexity: O(m+n)
